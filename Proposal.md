### **Project Description**

WanderLog is a minimalist travel blogging website where users can anonymously share their travel stories, reflections, and photos — no registration, no profiles, just pure storytelling.

The platform emphasizes **simplicity**, **privacy**, and **authenticity**. Every post is immutable once published, ensuring that stories capture the raw emotion of the moment. Readers can browse, comment, and engage anonymously, turning WanderLog into a peaceful, collective space for travel memories.
